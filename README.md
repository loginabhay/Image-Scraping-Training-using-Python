# Image-Scraping and Training-using-Python
Steps involved in the process:
1. Dataset is downloaded with the help of image scrapping
2. Several algorithms are applied in order to classify the image and compare their performences the algorithms are listed below:
a. Support vector machine
b. Neural Network
c. Convolutional Neural Network
d. Transfer Learning
